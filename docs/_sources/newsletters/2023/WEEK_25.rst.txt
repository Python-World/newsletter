1. 🐍 Power of the “repr” function in python.
*********************************************

🐍 Python developers, let’s dive into the fascinating world of the
“repr” function! 🎉

⚡️ Have you ever encountered a situation where “print” gives you a
different result than “repr”? Let me show you the magic of “repr” in
such scenarios.

🔍 Imagine you have a complex object with intricate internal state. When
you use “print” to display it, you might get an output that doesn’t
reveal the full picture. But fear not! “repr” comes to the rescue.

💡 The “repr” function provides a detailed and unambiguous string
representation of an object, perfect for debugging and understanding its
internals.

🌟 Let’s consider a complex example:

.. code:: python

   import datetime

   now = datetime.datetime.now()

   print("Printing using print:")
   print(now)  # Output: 2023-06-22 15:30:45.123456

   print("\nPrinting using repr:")
   print(repr(now))  # Output: datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 22, 15, 30, 45, 123456)

🔎 Notice the difference? While “print” gives us a more human-readable
representation, “repr” provides an exact and detailed view of the
object.

🎯 “repr” is a valuable tool when debugging complex data structures or
objects with custom implementations. It helps us uncover hidden details
and understand the inner workings of our code.

💡 So, remember to leverage the power of “repr” whenever you encounter
complex objects that need thorough inspection!

✨ Let’s embrace “repr” and unlock new levels of debugging and
understanding in our Python projects. Happy coding, everyone! 💻


2. 🌈 Enhancing console output with ANSI color codes.
*****************************************************

Do you want to add some pizzazz to your Python console output? 💥 Say
hello to ANSI escape codes! 🎨✨

ANSI escape codes are special character sequences that allow you to
change the color and formatting of text in the console or terminal.
Let’s take a look at how you can use them in Python to bring your
console output to life! 🚀

.. code:: python

   # ANSI color codes
   RESET = "\033[0m"
   RED = "\033[31m"
   GREEN = "\033[32m"
   YELLOW = "\033[33m"
   BLUE = "\033[34m"
   MAGENTA = "\033[35m"
   CYAN = "\033[36m"
   WHITE = "\033[37m"

   # Example usage
   print(RED + "This text is red." + RESET)
   print(GREEN + "This text is green." + RESET)
   print(YELLOW + "This text is yellow." + RESET)
   print(BLUE + "This text is blue." + RESET)
   print(MAGENTA + "This text is magenta." + RESET)
   print(CYAN + "This text is cyan." + RESET)
   print(WHITE + "This text is white." + RESET)

With just a few lines of code, you can transform your console output
into a vibrant display of colors. 🌈✨ Imagine the possibilities! 🎉

However, keep in mind that ANSI escape codes may not work on all
terminals or console emulators, especially on Windows. But don’t worry,
Windows users can achieve similar effects by using the ``colorama``
library. Simply install it with ``pip install colorama`` and modify the
code as follows:

.. code:: python

   from colorama import Fore, Style

   # Example usage
   print(Fore.RED + "This text is red." + Style.RESET_ALL)
   print(Fore.GREEN + "This text is green." + Style.RESET_ALL)
   print(Fore.YELLOW + "This text is yellow." + Style.RESET_ALL)
   print(Fore.BLUE + "This text is blue." + Style.RESET_ALL)
   print(Fore.MAGENTA + "This text is magenta." + Style.RESET_ALL)
   print(Fore.CYAN + "This text is cyan." + Style.RESET_ALL)
   print(Fore.WHITE + "This text is white." + Style.RESET_ALL)

Now you can enjoy colorful console output on any platform! 🎉🎉

So go ahead and make your Python console output stand out from the
crowd. Impress your colleagues and friends with eye-catching displays of
information. 🌟✨

Have fun experimenting with ANSI color codes in Python, and let your
imagination run wild! 🚀🐍

3. 🔀 Partial method in python
*******************************

Partial methods are a fascinating feature in Python that allow you to
create new methods from existing ones by pre-filling some of the
arguments. This enables you to customize and specialize functions
without the need for repetitive code. Let’s explore this concept
further! 💡🔧

Imagine you have a function with multiple arguments, and you frequently
call it with some fixed values for some of the parameters. Instead of
passing those values every time you call the function, you can use
partial methods to create a new function with those arguments already
filled in. This can make your code more concise and easier to read. 🧩✨

In Python, you can utilize the ``functools`` module to create partial
methods. The ``functools`` module provides the ``partial`` function,
which takes a callable and any number of arguments or keyword arguments.
It returns a new partial object, which can be called as a regular
function. 💻🔍

Here’s an example to illustrate the concept: 📝

.. code:: python

   from functools import partial

   def greet(name, greeting):
       print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

   say_hello = partial(greet, greeting="Hello")
   say_hello("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
   say_hello("Bob")    # Output: Hello, Bob!

In the example above, we defined a ``greet`` function that takes two
arguments: ``name`` and ``greeting``. By using ``partial``, we created a
new function called ``say_hello``, where the ``greeting`` argument is
already set to “Hello”. Now, whenever we call ``say_hello``, we only
need to provide the ``name`` argument. 👋👋

Partial methods are particularly useful when working with libraries or
frameworks that require callback functions with predefined arguments.
Instead of writing separate functions for each callback, you can use
partial methods to create specialized callbacks without duplicating
code. 📚🧪

Remember that partial methods are not limited to positional arguments
only; you can also use them with keyword arguments. Additionally, you
can modify or override any of the pre-filled arguments when calling the
partial method, providing you with even more flexibility. 🎛️🔀

4. 🔑 Encoding and Decoding using Base64
*****************************************

Base64 encoding is commonly used when you need to represent binary data,
such as images or files, as ASCII text. It converts binary data into a
string of characters that are safe to transmit or store, ensuring
compatibility across different systems and protocols. Python provides a
convenient way to perform base64 encoding and decoding using the
built-in ``base64`` module. 📚🔡

Let’s take a look at an example to see how base64 encoding and decoding
work: 🖥️🔑

.. code:: python

   import base64

   # Encoding binary data to base64
   data = b"Python-World"
   encoded_data = base64.b64encode(data)
   print(encoded_data)  # Output: b'UHl0aG9uLVdvcmxk'

   # Decoding base64 data to binary
   decoded_data = base64.b64decode(encoded_data)
   print(decoded_data)  # Output: b'Python-World'

In the example above, we imported the ``base64`` module and encoded the
binary data “Python-World” using ``base64.b64encode()``. The result,
``encoded_data``, is a byte string representing the base64 encoded
version of the data. When printing ``encoded_data``, the ``b`` prefix
indicates that it is a byte string. 📜🔢

To decode the base64 data back into its original binary form, we used
``base64.b64decode()`` and assigned the result to ``decoded_data``.
Printing ``decoded_data`` shows that it successfully restored the
original binary data. 🔄🔤

Base64 encoding and decoding have various applications, including data
transmission over email, storage of binary data in JSON or XML formats,
and handling binary data in network protocols. Understanding base64
encoding is essential when working with data that needs to be safely
represented as text. 📡📦

Python’s ``base64`` module provides additional functionalities, such as
handling URL-safe base64 encoding and decoding, as well as encoding and
decoding using different character sets. Exploring these options can
further enhance your encoding and decoding capabilities. 🌐🔠

5. 🎣 Understanding hooks in requests
*************************************

Hooks in the ``requests`` module provide a mechanism to intercept and
modify the request and response flow. They enable you to inject your own
code at various stages of the request lifecycle, empowering you to
perform custom processing, logging, authentication, error handling, and
much more. Hooks are a powerful tool to enhance and tailor your HTTP
requests according to your specific needs. 💡🔌

.. raw:: html

   <h4>

Types of Hooks:

.. raw:: html

   </h4>

1. Response Hooks:

   -  ``response``: Executed after a response is received, regardless of
      the response status.

These hooks provide immense flexibility and control over your requests,
enabling you to customize and augment the behavior as per your
requirements. ⚙️🎛️

.. raw:: html

   <h4>

🎯 Use Cases for Hooks:

.. raw:: html

   </h4>

Hooks can be employed in various scenarios to enhance the functionality
of your requests. Some common use cases include:

1. Logging: Add logging statements to track the request and response
   details for debugging or analysis purposes.
2. Authentication: Implement custom authentication mechanisms or token
   management.
3. Error Handling: Define actions to be taken when specific exceptions
   occur during the request.
4. Retry Strategies: Implement custom retry logic based on response
   status codes or error conditions.

.. raw:: html

   <h4>

🌟 Registering Hooks with Specific Requests:

.. raw:: html

   </h4>

In addition to registering global hooks, you can also specify hooks as
keyword parameters when making individual requests using methods like
``get``, ``post``, ``put``, etc. This allows you to define hooks
specifically for a particular request and control their execution on a
per-request basis. Here’s an example:

.. code:: python

   import requests

   def first_hook(response, *args, **kwargs):
       # Perform custom logic for the first hook
       print("First hook executed")
       response.first_hook='you can pass any value or object'

   def second_hook(response, *args, **kwargs):
       # Perform custom logic for the second hook
       print("Second hook executed")

   # Make a request with multiple hooks
   response = requests.get('https://www.example.com', hooks={'response': [first_hook, second_hook]})

   # Retrive first_hook parameters
   print(response.first_hook)

In this case, both ``first_hook`` and ``second_hook`` will be executed
for the single request made in the ``get`` method.

.. raw:: html

   <h4>

🚀 Registering Hooks with a Session:

.. raw:: html

   </h4>

If you need to maintain state or persist hooks across multiple requests,
you can use a ``requests.Session`` object. Here’s an example:

.. code:: python

   import requests

   def custom_hook(response, *args, **kwargs):
       # Perform custom logic
       print("Custom hook executed")

       # Also U can set custom attibute to response object
       response.custom_hook_called=True
       

   # Create a session and register the custom hook
   session = requests.Session()
   session.hooks['response'].append(custom_hook)

   # Make requests using the session
   response1 = session.get('https://www.example.com')

   ## Status of custom hooks
   print("parameter from custom hooks:",response1.custom_hook_called)

In this example, the ``custom_hook`` will be executed for both
``response1`` and ``response2``, as they are made using the same
session.

6. 📢 LinkExtractor in Scrapy
*****************************

🔗 The LinkExtractor class in Scrapy is a powerful tool for extracting
links from web pages. It provides a convenient way to crawl and scrape
websites efficiently. Let’s dive into some simple code examples to
understand how it works.

📝 Code Example:

.. code:: python


   import scrapy
   from scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess
   from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor

   class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):
       name = 'example'
       start_urls = ['http://www.example.com']

       def parse(self, response):
           # Instantiate a LinkExtractor object
           link_extractor = LinkExtractor()

           # Extract links from the response
           links = link_extractor.extract_links(response)

           # Process the extracted links
           for link in links:
               # Access the URL, text, and other attributes of the link
               yield {
                   'url': link.url,
                   'text': link.text
               }

               

   # Create a CrawlerProcess instance
   process = CrawlerProcess()

   # Add your spider to the CrawlerProcess
   process.crawl(MySpider)

   # Start the crawling process
   process.start()


   # Output: > {'url': 'https://www.iana.org/domains/example', 'text': 'More information...'}

🔍 In this example, we create a Scrapy spider named ``MySpider``. The
``LinkExtractor`` class is imported from ``scrapy.linkextractors`` to
handle link extraction.

🕸️ Inside the ``parse`` method, we instantiate a ``LinkExtractor``
object. Then, we use the ``extract_links`` method to extract all links
from the ``response`` object.

🔗 We iterate over the extracted links and access their URL and text
using the ``url`` and ``text`` attributes. You can perform further
processing or extraction based on your specific needs.

📥 Finally, we yield a dictionary containing the URL and text of each
extracted link. You can modify this code to process the links
differently or store them in any desired format.

💡 The LinkExtractor class provides many additional options and
parameters to customize link extraction based on patterns, tags,
attributes, and more. Make sure to explore the Scrapy documentation for
more advanced usage.
                
7. 📝 itemgetter in python
***************************

🔍 The ``itemgetter`` function in Python is a convenient tool for
extracting specific elements from iterable objects. It provides a simple
and efficient way to access and manipulate data. Let’s explore its
functionality with some simple code examples, including its usage in
``sorted`` with lists, dictionaries, and lists of dictionaries.

In general, if you need to access specific elements from iterable
objects and performance is a concern, using ``itemgetter`` is a
recommended approach. It offers better performance compared to using a
lambda function, particularly when dealing with large datasets or
performing operations that need to be executed multiple times.

📝 Code Example:

.. code:: python

   from operator import itemgetter

   # Example 1: Accessing Elements from a List
   my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
   get_second_element = itemgetter(1)
   print(get_second_element(my_list))  # Output: 'banana'

   # Example 2: Accessing Elements from a Dictionary
   my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
   get_age = itemgetter('age')
   print(get_age(my_dict))  # Output: 30

   # Example 3: Accessing Multiple Elements from a Tuple
   my_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date')
   get_first_and_last = itemgetter(0, -1)
   print(get_first_and_last(my_tuple))  # Output: ('apple', 'date')

   # Example 4: Using itemgetter in sorted with a List of Tuples
   students = [('John', 20, 'A'),('Alice', 19, 'B'),('Bob', 21, 'A-'),('Carol', 18, 'B+')]
   sorted_students = sorted(students, key=itemgetter(2))
   print(sorted_students)

   # Example 5: Using itemgetter in sorted with a Dictionary
   student_grades = {'John': 'A','Alice': 'B','Bob': 'A-','Carol': 'B+'}
   sorted_grades = sorted(student_grades.items(), key=itemgetter(1))
   print(sorted_grades)

   # Example 6: Using itemgetter in sorted with a List of Dictionaries
   people = [
       {'name': 'John', 'age': 25},
       {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30},
       {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 20},
       {'name': 'Carol', 'age': 35}
   ]
   sorted_people = sorted(people, key=itemgetter('age'))
   print(sorted_people)

🔢 In these examples, we import the ``itemgetter`` function from the
``operator`` module to extract specific elements from iterable objects.

📌 Examples 1, 2, and 3 demonstrate how ``itemgetter`` can be used to
access elements from a list, dictionary, and tuple, respectively.

📌 Example 4 showcases the usage of ``itemgetter`` in the ``sorted``
function with a list of tuples. By specifying ``key=itemgetter(2)``, the
``sorted`` function sorts the students based on their grade (the third
element in each tuple).

📌 Example 5 illustrates how ``itemgetter`` can be used with the
``sorted`` function with a dictionary. We convert the dictionary items
into a list of tuples using the ``items()`` method and then sort the
tuples based on the grades using ``key=itemgetter(1)``.

📌 Example 6 demonstrates the usage of ``itemgetter`` in the ``sorted``
function with a list of dictionaries. By specifying
``key=itemgetter('age')``, the ``sorted`` function sorts the list of
dictionaries based on the ‘age’ key, resulting in a sorted list of

people based on their age.

💡 The ``itemgetter`` function is a powerful tool for accessing and
sorting specific elements from iterable objects. It offers flexibility
and performance benefits, making it a valuable addition to your Python
toolkit.

8. 🖥️ Fetching device name using platform
******************************************

🔍 The ``platform`` module in Python provides a convenient way to access
information about the platform your code is running on. Let’s dive into
how you can use this module to fetch the device name:

🔦 **Fetching Device Name:** The ``platform`` module’s ``node()``
function returns the device’s network name, which is often the device’s
hostname. This can provide a reasonable approximation of the device name
in many cases.

.. code:: python

   import platform

   device_name = platform.node()
   print(f"Device Name: {device_name}")

🖥️💻📱 The ``device_name`` variable will contain the name of the device
your code is running on, which could be the hostname of the machine or a
recognizable identifier for the device.

🚀 **Platform Information:** The ``platform`` module can provide more
than just the device name. You can also access other platform-related
information, such as the operating system, Python implementation, and
architecture.

.. code:: python

   import platform

   # Get the operating system name
   os_name = platform.system()
   print(f"Operating System: {os_name}")

   # Get the release version of the operating system
   os_release = platform.release()
   print(f"Release Version: {os_release}")

   # Get the version of the operating system
   os_version = platform.version()
   print(f"OS Version: {os_version}")

   # Get the machine type
   machine_type = platform.machine()
   print(f"Machine Type: {machine_type}")

   # Get the processor name or identifier
   processor = platform.processor()
   print(f"Processor: {processor}")

   # Get the version of Python
   python_version = platform.python_version()
   print(f"Python Version: {python_version}")

   # Get the name of the Python implementation
   python_implementation = platform.python_implementation()
   print(f"Python Implementation: {python_implementation}")

   # Get the compiler used to build Python
   python_compiler = platform.python_compiler()
   print(f"Python Compiler: {python_compiler}")

   # Get the architecture and bitness of the operating system
   architecture, bitness = platform.architecture()
   print(f"Architecture: {architecture}")
   print(f"Bitness: {bitness}")

   # Get the network name of the device
   device_name = platform.node()
   print(f"Device Name: {device_name}")

   '''
   Output:
   Operating System: Windows
   Release Version: 11
   OS Version: 12.0.22334621

   '''

📡 **Platform-Specific Functionality:** By knowing the device name or
platform, you can tailor your code’s behavior to provide
platform-specific functionality. For example, you can enable or disable
certain features, adjust settings, or optimize code paths based on the
device or platform your code is running on.

💡 Fetching the device name using the ``platform`` module allows you to
adapt your code to different devices and platforms. It opens up
possibilities for building cross-platform applications, device-specific
optimizations, and customized user experiences.

9. 🌟 Package your app into a executable file using zipapp
**********************************************************


🔍 **What is Zipapp?** Zipapp is a module introduced in Python 3.5 that

10. 🔧 Secure User Input with getpass()
****************************************

🔎 When it comes to handling sensitive user input, such as passwords or other confidential information, security is of utmost importance.the `getpass()` method, which provides a secure way to accept user input without displaying it on the screen.

**What is getpass()?** 

The `getpass()` method is a part of the Python `getpass` module. It is used to prompt the user for input, such as a password, and securely captures the input without echoing it back to the screen.

🚀 **Key Features and Benefits:**

- **Secure User Input:** The `getpass()` method ensures that sensitive user input, like passwords, remains hidden, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The method works consistently across different operating systems, providing a reliable solution for secure user input.
- **Simplicity of Use:** With a single function call, you can prompt the user for input and retrieve it securely, without the need for complex code.

🔧 **Using getpass():**

Using the `getpass()` method is straightforward. Here's a simple example:

.. code:: python

  import getpass
  
  password = getpass.getpass("Enter your password: ")
  print("Password entered:", password)


When you run this code, the `getpass()` method will prompt the user to enter a password, and the input will be securely captured without being displayed on the screen.

💡 **Best Practices:**

- **Avoid Storing Passwords in Plain Text:** Remember, the `getpass()` method only helps in securely capturing user input. It's essential to handle the captured passwords carefully and avoid storing them in plain text. Consider using secure password storage mechanisms like hashing and salting.
- **Ensure Proper Error Handling:** Handle exceptions raised by the `getpass()` method to provide meaningful error messages and gracefully handle any issues encountered during user input.

The `getpass()` method is a valuable tool for securely capturing sensitive user input, making it an ideal choice when handling passwords or other confidential information. By using this method, you can enhance the security of your applications and protect user privacy.
